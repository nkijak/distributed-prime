Demo of distributed prime number calculation.  To compute more numbers faster just open up the index page in more browsers. Requires redis-server to be installed and running.

* sudo apt-get install redis-server node npm

(node probably wont be the right version on ubuntu google for it.)

* npm install
* node server


(in browser)
http://localhost:3010

click "Go!"
